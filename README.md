# Bus Management System
In the bus management system, I used C++ language and also used window form. I shared this code because students work on C++ language but if they work on Window Form, it prefer C#, because window form in C++ is too difficult and source does not found on internet. So thats why students prefer C# because window form in C# is easy but it could not clear the concepts when they move on C#. So I shared this project and Students can get help from this project.
In this project there are 4 modules:
* Manager/Admin Side
* Driver Module
* Ticket Issuer
* Passenger Module

## Here is the output screen
